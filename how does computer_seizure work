Basically computer seizure works when it kills all the processes in computer and  not leave even 1% of process activated.Then computer activates some important process which were killed by computer_seizure but non important processes killed by computer seizure is not reactiveted again by computer.The computer seizure kills the processes by looping the list of processes names and killing the process by it's name.
